## Changelog
This is the Changelog file. any important changes that are done will be marked here. I cannot promise everything is neat or organized to just expect to see a mess of text below.

## v0.2-b
### Added
- Miss counter next to score
- A few easter eggs
- Modcharts (WIP)
- In-Game config has a single option called "Debug Mode" (Mostly for testing, probably doesn't work)
- Added MISSFX, MISSIntensity, MISSDir and CACHE config options.
- Missing notes will cause the screen to shake a little bit (highly configurable)
- Notes that you fail to hit will trigger the miss animations and sounds, also resets the combo.
- Changed Bopeebo to use the original music and voices (seriously I like them a lot better than the new one)
- Prototype failsafe for attempting to load a song that doesn't exist
- Some more Icons to the DiscordRPC

### Fixed
- Revamped the DiscordRPC design
- Completely revamped the console outputs. (Way less cluttered and is much more specific about what its doing)
- Added "Bookmark" comments (Makes finding parts of the code a LOT easier, just search for the bookmark)
- Added a small outline to the score text to make it visible in Week 5 or just really bright enviroments
- Limo GF animations re-done
- Fixed the Story Mode menu assets having terrible cropping *(re-exported the week assets and added padding to the difficulties)*
- Week tracks is now yellow *(It actually looks really nice)*
- That last part of high being incorrect *(it was flipped)*
- Updated the [itch.io](https://aflacck.itch.io/projectfnf) build to use v0.2-b *(the itch wont recieve updates too often)*

### Removed
- Freeplay Caching *(configurable, but false by default)*
- "Neo" difficulty asset *(was never supposed to even be in the assets)*
